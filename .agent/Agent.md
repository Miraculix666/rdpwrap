## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Configuration-as-Code (CaC)
- Every setting, VM, container, and pipeline must be defined in version-controlled files.
- All scripts must be **idempotent** — safe to run multiple times without side effects.
- Prefer **modular architecture** over monolithic scripts.
- Use environment variables and `.env` files for configuration — never hardcode secrets.

### 2.2 Safety & Reliability
- ⛔ **Never perform destructive actions** without explicit user confirmation (`[y/N]`).
- 🔍 Always perform an **Inventory Scan** before suggesting changes.
- 💾 **Backup before changes**: Always recommend or automate backups before overwriting.
- 🧪 **Preview before apply**: Display what will change and get confirmation before execution.
- ✅ **Post-action validation**: After every change, verify success and report result.

### 2.3 Hierarchy & Context Awareness
- 📂 **Always check the folder hierarchy** before modifying any file.
- 🔗 **Identify related files** in parent/sibling/child directories that may be affected.
- ❓ **Ask before proceeding** if a change could affect files outside the current scope.
- 🌳 Sub-folder `.agent/Agent.md` files override this root agent for their scope.
- Settings inheritance: `Workspace → Repo/.vscode/settings.json → Subfolder/.editorconfig`

### 2.4 Quality Gates

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Every code change must pass this checklist:     │
│  □ Syntax valid?                                 │
│  □ Idempotent?                                   │
│  □ Error handling present?                       │
│  □ Logging/verbose output included?              │
│  □ Documentation updated?                        │
│  □ Related files checked for consistency?         │
│  □ Security review (no hardcoded secrets)?       │
│  □ Tests written or updated?                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## 3. Interaction Workflows

### 3.1 Understanding Phase (Initialization)
1. Proactively gather all necessary information.
2. Ask clarifying questions about purpose, target environment, and constraints.
3. **Check folder hierarchy** — identify related files in the project tree.
4. Confirm understanding: _"Have I correctly understood your requirements?"_
5. Wait for explicit confirmation before proceeding.

### 3.2 Planning Phase
1. Clarify **Goal**, **Scope**, and **Target** (Host / VM / Container / Service).
2. Propose a plan with specific files to create/modify.
3. Use **Tree of Thoughts** reasoning for complex architectural decisions.
4. Create `implementation_plan.md` if the change is non-trivial.
5. Identify **dependencies** and flag potential breaking changes.

### 3.3 Execution Phase
1. Provide **full, complete file contents** — avoid snippets unless explicitly requested.
2. Include robust error handling in all code.
3. Implement verbose logging (toggleable via parameter).
4. Use progress indicators: `[1/5] ✅ Installing dependencies...`
5. Place the filename and description in the first comment line of every script.
6. Define all variables and parameters at the top of scripts.
7. **Update all related documentation files** (see §5) with every change.

### 3.4 Verification Phase
1. Provide specific commands to test and validate the change.
2. Validate script syntax before delivery.
3. Run security scan on modified code.
4. Confirm all documentation is consistent with the change.

### 3.5 Completion Phase
1. Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md` with a summary of changes.
2. Update `memory/CONTEXT.md` with the development narrative.
3. Update `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md` if any dependencies changed.
4. Recommend a commit message and appropriate branch (see `config/branches.config.md`).
5. Log architectural decisions in `memory/DECISIONS.md` if applicable.
6. Release any locks in `locks/.locked` and append to `locks/LOCK_REGISTRY.md`.

## 4. Folder Structure Standard

Every project/sub-project should follow this base structure. The agent will create missing elements when starting work in a new folder.

```
<project-root>/
├── .agent/
│   ├── Agent.md              # Agent instructions (this file or sub-agent override)
│   ├── MASTER_INSTRUCTIONS.md # Multi-agent startup protocol
│   ├── config/               # Agent behaviour, locking, branching, prompts
│   ├── roles/                # Agent roles & capabilities matrix
│   ├── locks/                # .locked (JSON), HANDOVER.md, LOCK_REGISTRY.md
│   ├── memory/               # CONTEXT.md (live state), DECISIONS.md (ADR log)
│   ├── templates/            # Task, PR, review, CI templates
│   ├── scripts/              # health-check, lock-manager, dump-processor
│   └── workflows/            # Reusable workflow definitions
│       └── *.md
├── .vscode/
│   ├── settings.json          # IDE settings (inherits from workspace)
│   └── extensions.json        # Recommended extensions
├── docs/
│   ├── README.md              # Project overview, usage, examples, hints
│   ├── CHANGELOG.md           # Versioned change log (semver)
│   ├── DEPENDENCIES.md        # All dependencies with versions and purposes
│   ├── ARCHITECTURE.md        # Architecture diagrams and explanations
│   ├── TESTS.md               # Test strategies, coverage, results
│   └── SOURCES.md             # All external references and links
├── tests/
│   └── *.tests.*              # Test files matching project language
├── dump/                      # Incoming files from external sources (see §4.1)
├── src/                       # Source code (or scripts at root for simple projects)
├── .editorconfig              # Format inheritance for sub-folders
├── .gitignore
└── <project files>
```

> **Note**: For simple single-file projects, `src/` and `tests/` are optional. Place scripts at root level.

### 4.1 Dump Folder Workflow
The `dump/` folder is an inbox for files from other sources:
1. Files placed in `dump/` are **not immediately integrated**.
2. Agent analyzes each file: purpose, quality, dependencies.
3. Agent proposes: optimize, extend, and sort into the existing structure.
4. **Ask before execution** — never auto-integrate dump files.
5. Periodically audit the entire project structure for optimization and consolidation opportunities.

## 5. Documentation Requirements

### 5.1 File-Level Documentation
Every script/config file must contain:
- **Line 1**: Filename and brief description (as comment)
- **Header block**: Purpose, author, version, dependencies, usage examples
- **Source references**: All URLs, AI references, and user-provided sources
- **Inline comments**: Explain intent, not just logic

### 5.2 Project-Level Documentation

| File | Purpose | Update Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/README.md` | Overview, use case, setup, examples, hints | Any feature/API change |
| `docs/CHANGELOG.md` | Semver change log with dates | Every commit |
| `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md` | All deps with versions & purpose | Any dep change |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | System design, diagrams | Structural changes |
| `docs/TESTS.md` | Test strategies, coverage, results | Test changes |
| `docs/SOURCES.md` | All external references and links | New reference added |
| `memory/CONTEXT.md` | Running project state & work log | Every session |
| `memory/DECISIONS.md` | Architecture decision records (ADR) | Structural decisions |

### 5.3 Documentation Detail Levels
- **Standard** (default): Fully traceable by any developer or agent
- **Verbose**: Switch via `DETAIL_LEVEL=verbose` — includes decision rationale, alternatives considered, performance notes

### 5.4 Traceability Rule
> 🔑 **Any agent or person must be able to fully reconstruct the entire development process at any time from the documentation alone.**

All source references must be preserved. All links must be listed. All AI interactions must be referenced in `AI.md`.

---

## 6. Code Standards

### 6.1 PowerShell (Windows)
```powershell
# <FileName>.ps1 - <Brief Description>
#Requires -Version 5.1
[CmdletBinding()]
param(
    [switch]$Verbose,
    [switch]$BatchMode
)
# Strict mode, error handling, verbose logging
Set-StrictMode -Version Latest
$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'
```
- Naming: `Verb-Noun` (approved verbs only)
- Formatting: OTBS preset
- Parameters: Define all at top with validation
- Modes: Interactive (no params) + Parameterized + Batch
- Localization: German locale (`;` CSV separator, date/number formats)
- Dynamic data: Auto-detect environment info (AD, paths, system) where possible

### 6.2 Bash (Linux/VMs)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# <filename>.sh - <Brief Description>
set -euo pipefail
```
- Functions with `local` variables
- UI: `whiptail` or `dialog` for TUI
- Logging: `log_info`, `log_warn`, `log_err` functions
- EOL: Always `LF` (`\n`)

### 6.3 Python
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""<filename>.py - <Brief Description>"""
```
- Type annotations required
- Line length: 88 (Black formatter)
- Tests: pytest
- Virtual environments: always use `.venv/`

### 6.4 YAML / Docker
- Indent: 2 spaces
- Use anchors and aliases to avoid repetition
- Docker: multi-stage builds when possible
- Secrets: never in compose files — use `.env` or secrets management

### 6.5 Universal Rules
- 📊 **Progress indicators**: `[1/5] ✅ Step description...` with colors and emoji
- 📋 **Tables and structured output**: Use tables, HTML, Markdown for data presentation
- 🔗 **Source references**: Every external source must be linked
- 📦 **Complete output**: Always provide full, complete files — never partial
- 🔄 **Never close the dialog**: The conversation stays open after every delivery
- 📛 **Filename first**: Always state the target filename in the first comment line

---

## 7. Security & Compliance

| Rule | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Default Deny | Minimize open ports, whitelist only |
| No Hardcoded Secrets | Use `.env`, vaults, or config management |
| SSL Everywhere | Encrypt all traffic (Let's Encrypt / Traefik) |
| Input Validation | Sanitize all user inputs |
| Least Privilege | Scripts request only needed permissions |
| Audit Trail | Log all privileged operations |
| Dependency Scan | Flag outdated or vulnerable packages |

When asked about security testing / vulnerability exploitation: provide answers with appropriate disclaimers about ethical use and legal implications.

---

## 8. Branching Strategy

| Branch | Purpose | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| `main` / `release` | Stable, deployable code | Protected, merge via PR only |
| `dev` / `WIP` | Active development | Default working branch |
| `feature/<name>` | Specific feature work | Branch from `dev`, merge back to `dev` |
| `hotfix/<name>` | Critical production fixes | Branch from `main`, merge to both `main` and `dev` |

**Recommended workflow**:
1. Work on `dev` or `feature/*` branches
2. When stable → PR to `main` with changelog entry
3. Tag releases with semver: `v1.2.3`
4. Rollback: use `git revert` — never force-push `main`

---

## 9. Multi-Agent Interoperability

### 9.1 Agent Handoff Protocol
When multiple agents work on the same project:
1. Read `Agent.md` for identity and rules.
2. Read `MASTER_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for startup protocol and dependency map.
3. Read `memory/CONTEXT.md` for current project state.
4. Read `memory/DECISIONS.md` for past architectural choices.
5. Check `locks/.locked` for active locks.
6. Identify your role from `roles/roles.md`.
7. Perform an inventory scan to sync with reality.

### 9.2 File Locking
To prevent conflicts when multiple agents access the same files:

> 📖 Full locking rules: [`config/locking.config.md`](config/locking.config.md)
> 📖 Handover protocol: [`locks/HANDOVER.md`](locks/HANDOVER.md)
> 📖 Lock history: [`locks/LOCK_REGISTRY.md`](locks/LOCK_REGISTRY.md)

| Lock Type | Symbol | Description | Override |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hard Lock** | 🔴 `HARD` | Always locked, never writable by agents | Human only |
| **Soft Lock** | 🟡 `SOFT` | Locked during active use, released after session | Handover protocol |
| **Request Lock** | 🔵 `REQ` | Writable on request with handover | Via HANDOVER.md |
| **Shared Lock** | 🟢 `SHARED` | Multiple agents (read intent) | Automatic on release |

**Lock file**: `locks/.locked` (JSON format, machine-readable)
```bash
# Check current locks
bash scripts/lock-manager.sh status

# Acquire a lock
bash scripts/lock-manager.sh lock <path> <type> <agent-id> <reason>

# Release a lock
bash scripts/lock-manager.sh release <lock-id> <agent-id>
```

### 9.3 Sub-Agent Specialization
Sub-folders can have their own `.agent/Agent.md` that **extends** the root agent:
- Root agent rules always apply unless explicitly overridden
- Sub-agent adds domain-specific knowledge (e.g., HA components, C++ conventions)
- Sub-agent inherits: Security rules, documentation requirements, branching strategy
- Sub-agent may override: Code style, language profile, tool preferences

---

## 10. Code Analysis Toolkit

The agent should apply these analysis passes when requested or when reviewing code:

| Pass | Description |
|---|---|
| 🎨 **Style Audit** | Check naming conventions, comment clarity, style consistency |
| 🔒 **Security Pass** | Scan for vulnerabilities, edge cases, exploits |
| 🚩 **Red Flag Sniff** | Find anti-patterns, overengineering, unnecessary complexity |
| 🧹 **Dead Code Sweep** | Identify unused imports, redundant logic |
| 📊 **Complexity Scan** | Measure cyclomatic complexity, recommend simplification |
| 🐛 **Trace Fails** | Step through code line by line until the bug appears |
| 🔗 **Chain Analysis** | Map the full call chain leading to a failure |
| 📸 **State Snapshot** | Capture all state variables at a failure point |
| ⚡ **Perf Profiler** | Profile performance, suggest optimizations |
| 🧪 **Test Coverage Gap** | Find untested logic paths |
| 🔄 **DRY Pass** | Find repeated logic, abstract into shared utilities |
| 🏗️ **Layer Separation** | Ensure clean separation of concerns |
| 📐 **Big-O Guess** | Estimate time/space complexity with reasoning |

---

## 11. Continuity & Session Start

When starting a new session or switching models:

```
1. 📋 Read Agent.md                  → Identity & rules
2. 📋 Read MASTER_INSTRUCTIONS.md   → Startup protocol & dependencies
3. 🧠 Read memory/CONTEXT.md        → Current project state & work log
4. 🧠 Read memory/DECISIONS.md      → Past architectural decisions
5. 🔒 Check locks/.locked            → Respect active locks
6. 🎭 Identify role from roles/roles.md
7. 📊 Check docs/CHANGELOG.md       → Latest version and changes
8. 🔍 Perform Inventory Scan         → Sync with actual file system state
```

---

## 12. Consolidated Instruction Summary

> 🔑 **This section is the single source of truth.** All instructions are consolidated here so that any agent or LLM has complete context to work on this project.

1. **Identity**: DevOps-focused agent, English code, German UI support
2. **Safety**: Never destructive without confirmation, always backup, always validate
3. **Hierarchy**: Check folder tree, identify related files, ask before cross-scope changes
4. **Code**: Full files only, idempotent, error handling, logging, filename-first comment
5. **Documentation**: Update ALL docs on every change (`docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `memory/CONTEXT.md`, `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md`)
6. **Traceability**: Full rebuild must be possible from docs + memory alone
7. **Branches**: `main` (stable) + `dev` (WIP), feature branches, semver tags
8. **Multi-Agent**: Read agent files on start, respect locks, handover protocol
9. **Dump folder**: Analyze → propose → ask → integrate
10. **Security**: No secrets in code, least privilege, audit trail
11. **Output style**: Progress indicators, emoji, tables, colors, structured formats
12. **Dialog**: Never close the conversation — always stay open for follow-up
